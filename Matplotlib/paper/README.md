Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD)
====================================

kinetic_energy.py is used to plot kinetic energy as a fuction of time and with a insered small amplification graph (DDD).

velocity_distribution.py is used to plot velocity distribution.

position_average2.py and position_time.py are used to plot height difference as a function of difference.

Molecular Dynamics (MD)
=======================

disregistry_pressures.py is used to compare disregistries under diferent pressures.
