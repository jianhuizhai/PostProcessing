Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD)
====================================

1. __kinetic_energy.py__ is used to plot kinetic energy as a fuction of time and with a inserted small amplification graph (DDD).

2. __velocity_distribution.py__ is used to plot velocity distribution.

3. __position_average2.py__ and __position_time.py__ are used to plot height difference as a function of difference.

Molecular Dynamics (MD)
=======================

1. __disregistry_pressures.py__ is used to compare disregistries under different pressures.
2. __jogPair.py__ is used to plot dislocation jog configuration (position is determined from disregistry). (In MD folder)

Charge
======================
1. __charge_density.py__ is used to plot charge density (2D).

PointDefects
======================
1. __binding_energy.py__ is used to plot binding energy of vacancies.
