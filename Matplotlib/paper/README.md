Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD)
====================================

1. kinetic_energy.py is used to plot kinetic energy as a fuction of time and with a inserted small amplification graph (DDD).

2. velocity_distribution.py is used to plot velocity distribution.

3. position_average2.py and position_time.py are used to plot height difference as a function of difference.

Molecular Dynamics (MD)
=======================

1. disregistry_pressures.py is used to compare disregistries under different pressures.
2. jogPair.py is used to plot dislocation jog configuration (position is determined from disregistry). (In MD folder)
